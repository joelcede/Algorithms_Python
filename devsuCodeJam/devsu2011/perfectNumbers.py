# A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. 
# Create a function that receives two values X and Y and return the smaller perfect number found, 
# which is greater or equal than X and lower or equal than Y. 
# If no perfect number found, it should return -1 
# For example, if the function receives X=5, Y=7, 
# it should return 6, because 6 is the smaller perfect number between 5 and 7
