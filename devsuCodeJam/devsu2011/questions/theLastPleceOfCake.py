# Equilibrium index of a sequence is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal 
# to the sum of elements at higher indexes. 
# For example, if the array received is: A=[-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0] 3 is an equilibrium index, 
# because:A[0]+A[1]+A[2] = A[4]+A[5]+A[6] In other words, 
# you should find the index of the array where the sum of the left elements is equal to the sum 
# of the right elements. In the example, the function will return 3, 
# because itâ€™s the first equilibrium index found in the array.

A = [- 7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
